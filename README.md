# classification_Logistic_Regression
detecting fake bank notes using Log Reg (in Fr)
in this Jupyter notebook we use K-means to assess whiwh model tu use for binary response prediction, PCA to reduce dimensionality from 6D to 2D and evaluation of best contributing vars to dataset variability, Logistic Regression to use selected vars to predict binary vars (is bank note genuine or fake?)
we borrow code from https://github.com/epimed from here https://github.com/epimed/eoc-ai-session-2/blob/main/notebook/demo_pca_tsne_umap.ipynb, from http://cs109.github.io/2015/ from here https://github.com/cs109/2015lab4, and many video tutorials and of course Stackoverflow. Any comment welcome. Thanks
